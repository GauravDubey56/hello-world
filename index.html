                         Captain Vikram Batra was born on 9th September 1974 and hailed from Bandla Gaon in Palampur
                         district
                         of Himachal Pradesh. Son of Shri Girdhari Lal Batra and Smt Kamal Kanta, Capt Vikram Batra
                         received
                         his primary education from D.A.V Public School, Palampur and then completed his senior

                         Cadet (Air Wing) in the North Zone.
                         <br>
                         Right from his younger days, he was fearless and bold and ever-ready to offer help to anyone in
                         need. His helping nature coupled with pleasing manners made him likable to anyone who came in
                         contact with him. Besides being good in academics, he took keen interest in sports too and
                         specially
                         excelled in table tennis. While growing up he was greatly influenced by the inspirational
                         stories of
                         the “Param Vir Chakra” awardees. As a young boy he would watch the TV serial “Param Vir Chakra”
                         regularly and thereafter often discuss in detail their stories of courage and gallantry with
                         his
                         brother. Though he got selected to join the Merchant Navy, he knew his calling and had made up
                         his
                         mind to follow his dream of donning the Army uniform.
                         <br>
                         Consequently he got through the Combined Defence Services Examination and got selected to join
                         the
                         Indian Military Academy, Dehradun in 1994. He joined the Jessore Company of Manekshaw Battalion
                         and
                         was commissioned into 13 JAK Rifles, an infantry Regiment well known for its intrepid soldiers
                         and
                         numerous battle exploits. After being commissioned, he got posted to Sopore in Baramulla
                         district of
                         J&K as his first assignment. By April 1999, his unit had completed its field tenure and was
                         preparing to move to its peace location. But the detection of large scale intrusion by the
                         Pakistani
                         forces in Kargil sector in early May 1999 changed the operational scenario and the unit’s move
                         to
                         its peace location was cancelled.
