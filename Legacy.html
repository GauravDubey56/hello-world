                         <li>Captain Batra is also well known in India for using the slogan, Yeh Dil Maange More! as his
                              signal to communicate mission success. He is also known for an interview in which he
                              stated that Pakistani soldiers were aware of him as “Sher Shah” and addressed him as such
                              in the middle of engagements.</li>
                         <li>He has been honoured with several landmarks being named after him: The historic capture of
                              point 4875 led to the mountain being named ‘ Batra top’ in his honour.</li>
                         <li> A memorial for war veterans including Capt Batra stands at his Alma mater, DAV College,
                              Chandigarh honouring the services of the soldiers.</li>
                         <li> Captain Batra’s name is used by the Indian Army for various significant buildings and
                              cantonments in his remembrance. In a tribute paid by director J.P Dutta to the the
                              soldiers through a cinematic representation of the Kargil war “LOC Kargil” in the year
                              2003, Capt Batra’s character was essayed by Abhishek Bachchan.</li>
                         <li> Capt Vikram Batra would have joined the Merchant Navy and was to join the ship in Hong
                              Kong. His uniform had been stitched and his tickets booked. But he changed his mind and
                              served the army instead. A decade later, this decision became the opening line of an
                              Indian Oil print campaign. The public sector company paid tribute to the Kargil hero and
                              lauded him for rejecting a lucrative career for the service of the nation. ‘Sometimes an
                              ordinary Indian can make a Rs 120,000 crore company feel humble. For every step we take,
                              there’s an inspired Indian leading the way,’ read the ad caption , alongside a
                              black-and-white etching of Captain Batra.</li>
                         <li>A number of buildings in various cantonments have been named after him such as, a hall at
                              Service Selection Centre Allahabad has been named ‘Vikram Batra Block’, a residential area
                              in the Jabalpur Cantonment is called ‘Captain Vikram Batra Enclave’ and the combined
                              cadet’s mess at the Indian Medical Association has been named ‘Vikram Batra Mess’.</li>
